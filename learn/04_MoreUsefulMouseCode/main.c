 *	note:		
 *				The previous code was all well and good, but it wasn't very useful.
 *				To make the mouse functionality a bit more useful, we need to start storing
 *				information about which mouse buttons are held, how much the mouse has moved etc.
 *
 *				The code below doesn't do much other than show some sensible places to
 *				calculate some sensible values! At the moment the values are essentually
 *				informatioon on which buttons are pressed, the location of the cursor
 *				and the two motion functions calculate the amount that the mouse has moved
 *				since last time (dx,dy).

	 *	If other buttons are pressed when another button is pressed it will not update these
	 *	values. 
	 *
	 *	This allows us to "Set the Focus" to a specific portion of the screen. For example,
	 *	in maya, clicking the Alt+LMB in a view allows you to move the mouse about and alter
	 *	just that view. Essentually that viewport takes control of the mouse, therefore it is
